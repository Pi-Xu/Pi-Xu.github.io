      Hello there! I'm Wenqian Xu, currently pursuing my master's degree at the School of Statistics and Management, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics(SUFE), under the guidance of [Fan Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=4QJkjl0AAAAJ). I obtained my B.Sc. in Statistics from the School of Economics and Management, China University of Geosciences, where I was advised by [Deyi Xu](https://jgxy.cug.edu.cn/info/1161/6143.htm) and [Yongguang Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rpNV_GYAAAAJ&hl=en).
      
      My research interests are centered around **Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models, Explainable AI**, and **Visualization**. I focus on optimizing model training processes and enhancing learning efficiency through **Active Learning** strategies. You can view some of my completed projects [here](./#projects).
      

      Hello! I'm Wenqian Xu. I recently completed my M.Sc. in Statistics and Management at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE), where I worked with Prof. Fan Zhou. I received my B.Sc. in Statistics from the China University of Geosciences, advised by Prof. Deyi Xu and Prof. Yongguang Zhu. I am currently collaborating with Dr. Feng Ji at the University of Toronto on computational modeling in psychology.

      My research focuses on how humans learn and make decisions. I combine reinforcement learning with psychometric modeling to quantify individual decision abilities and support ability assessment in complex environments. I am also interested in method development — particularly in interpretable and robust RL systems that better connect behavioral data with psychological theory.

      You can find a selection of my projects [here](./#projects).
