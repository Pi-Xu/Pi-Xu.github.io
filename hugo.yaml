      Hello there! I'm Wenqian Xu, currently pursuing my master's degree at the School of Statistics and Management, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics(SUFE), under the guidance of [Fan Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=4QJkjl0AAAAJ). I obtained my B.Sc. in Statistics from the School of Economics and Management, China University of Geosciences, where I was advised by [Deyi Xu](https://jgxy.cug.edu.cn/info/1161/6143.htm) and [Yongguang Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rpNV_GYAAAAJ&hl=en).
      
      My research interests are centered around **Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models, Explainable AI**, and **Visualization**. I focus on optimizing model training processes and enhancing learning efficiency through **Active Learning** strategies. You can view some of my completed projects [here](./#projects).
      
      Additionally, I maintain a [Chinese Page](./pages-zn/) where I record my life using Mandarin.
